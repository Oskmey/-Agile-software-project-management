# DAT257 - Agile software project management
 This is our (Project Team 18) project and GitHub repository for Agile software project management, DAT257, a course at Chalmers University.
 
## Structure
### Running the project
This a Unity project, a game made with the Unity game engine, so it will be made to fit the structure that is required for it to function in the Unity Editor. To see the source of the code go into [DAT257AgileProject](https://github.com/Oskmey/-Agile-software-project-management/tree/main/DAT257AgileProject), that folder will contain source code and more. 

To run the project you will need to have Unity installed. The Unity Editor version for this project is 2022.3.23f1 LTS. When you have Unity installed, clone the repository and add the Unity Project via the Unity Hub application. 

To successfully play the project you need to start from the "Main Menu" scene in the [Game](https://github.com/Oskmey/-Agile-software-project-management/tree/bug_fixing_v2/DAT257AgileProject/Assets/Scenes/Game) folder.

### Tests
Go to [DAT257AgileProject/Assets/Tests](https://github.com/Oskmey/-Agile-software-project-management/tree/main/DAT257AgileProject/Assets/Tests) and under the folders [EditMode](https://github.com/Oskmey/-Agile-software-project-management/tree/main/DAT257AgileProject/Assets/Tests/EditMode) and [PlayMode](https://github.com/Oskmey/-Agile-software-project-management/tree/main/DAT257AgileProject/Assets/Tests/PlayMode) we have the tests, where mostly Unit Tests will be under the [EditMode](https://github.com/Oskmey/-Agile-software-project-management/tree/main/DAT257AgileProject/Assets/Tests/EditMode) folder, because they do not need to be at run time to execute. We use the [Unity Test Framework](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@1.1/manual/index.html) combined with [Code Coverage](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.testtools.codecoverage@0.2/manual/index.html) for Unity to run the tests. Note that you will need to have the scenes in the [Test](https://github.com/Oskmey/-Agile-software-project-management/tree/bug_fixing_v2/DAT257AgileProject/Assets/Scenes/Test) folder, in the build settings. As we use the test scenes for Play Mode testing.

### Running the application
To run our game application look at what is the latest release under [releases](https://github.com/Oskmey/-Agile-software-project-management/releases) for GitHub repository. Note that the most viable platform to run this application would be on Windows.
